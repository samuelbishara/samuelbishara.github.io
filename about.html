        <h2>Bio</h2>
        <p>
            I am student at the We Can Code It Java boot camp. I am one of the youngest, if not the youngest, student in the program. 
            My maturity, however, precedes my age which manifests in my goals to become a leader in software development. 
            I also have goals to start my own business in the field one day as well as to become a part-time real estate investor.  
            My strengths in math and science have earned me student of the year in math as well as a place in 
            advanced placement and honors classes in highschool. I am an voracious reader and love to play sports in my free time.
            I will accept any challenge to a good game of one-on-one basketball... as long as you're okay with losing.
